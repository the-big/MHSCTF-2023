`After brainstorming a bit, we got the idea that this file might be a program written in an esoteric programming language. 
After doing some research, we found out about "2-Dimensional programming languages." Searching the esolangs wiki (https://esolangs.org/wiki/Category:Two-dimensional_languages)
we found a language named "Fish," which matches both what was written in the file, and the file name.`  
`Using the python interpreter for Fish (https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6392418), I ran the program 5000 times, and wrote the outputs to another file. Then I counted
the times each digit appeared, divided them by 5, and entered the counts onto the website.`
